# RATTEL
RATTEL - RAT Timidity tester from Evidence based Learning.
A software to find optimal location for the deployment of [TOMCAT](http://2018.igem.org/Team:IISER-Mohali/Hardware#Tomcat)

## About software
The user has to input the number of Food Grain stacks, along with their locations in the 150 x 100 (unit)^2 arena.

The software calculates and displays the location for most effective deployment and displays the dynamics for that particular deployment location.

## Installation
The software runs on [MATLAB](https://in.mathworks.com/store?s_tid=gn_store).

## How to use?
### Input
* Input noumber of Food Grain Stackes when prompted.
* Input locations of each Food Grain Stack in [x,y] format (0<x<150 , 0<y<100)
### Output
* Heat map of order parameter.
* Optimal location for TOMCAT deployment.
* Complete motion simulation of response of rats for the most location prescribed by RATTEL.
